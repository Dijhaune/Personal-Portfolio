    <h2><u>Chapter 4</u></h2>
    <h3><i>"Achieve Your Goals"</i></h3>
    <p>This chapter focuses on the importance of goal setting. While Michael and Charlie, his mentor are engaging in a conversation, Michael shares that he feels as though he is not living up to his potential. To assist him, Charlie introduces him to the concept of goal-setting. He encourages him to write down his goals, both short-term and long-term, and make adjustments when and where necessary as success is not achieved overnight but through continual effort. With clear, realistic and well-defined objectives, individuals can reach their full potential. </p>

    <p>Setting personal and career goals can be really transformative in my life. By creating goals and taking small manageable steps toward this, I can better monitor my development, stay motivated and meet my full potential.  </p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 5</u></h2>
    <h3><i>"The Proper Use of Time"</i></h3>
    <p>This chapter focuses on the importance of time management in achieving true success. Charlie explains to Michael that time is very precious as it is very limited. People achieve success when they recognize the importance of managing their time properly and staying focused on achieving goals. In addition, it is critical to prioritize crucial tasks and find a balance between work and personal life. How one deals with their time now will determine their future success. </p>

    <p>There are many regrets that I have had because of mistakes made in the past. Many times distractions have led to procrastination, which in turn hampers my chance of success. Based on Charlie’s advice, I have learnt that to be successful in accomplishing set goals, I have to be focused and very disciplined. I need to be able to identify the tasks that directly contribute to my goals, block out distractions, and maintain a balance in my life. </p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 6</u></h2>
    <h3><i>"Surround Yourself With the Best People"</i></h3>
    <p>This chapter speaks to the importance of the company we keep. Charlie advises Michael that he has to be careful with the people he associates with. His friends, co-workers, family, etc. We are influenced by the people with surround ourselves with even if we do not recognise it. He encourages Michael to make company with people who share similar goals and good qualities. Associating with persons of this nature can elevate our performance and mindset.</p>

    <p>I can start this process by first evaluating the persons I interact with frequently. By doing this I can seek closer associations with persons who are and will be a positive influence on my life and interact less with those bringing negative influences. Like Michael, I have to realize that even though it might be hard to let go of certain people, it is imperative that I do what is best in order to reach my full potential and meet my goals.</p>

    <h2><u>Chapter 7</u></h2>
    <h3><i>"Be a Life-Long Learner"</i></h3>
    <p>Being a life-long learner focuses on the value of continuous learning and growth. Charlie advises Michael to adopt an attitude of continuous growth because genuine success stems from lifelong learning and skill enhancement.  Persons can continue to change and adapt if they maintain their curiosity, read books, look for new experiences, and absorb knowledge from successful people. He stressed that reading books is one of the greatest learning tools in human history. He explains that books offer extensive knowledge, wisdom, and experiences from successful individuals across various fields, enabling individuals to learn new concepts and gain diverse perspectives.</p>

    <p>This chapter encourages me to emphasize learning not just at school but from everything. I need to develop curious, determined and observant attitudes so I can learn from my environment and experiences. In addition, focusing on expanding my knowledge in various fields will enhance my skills and expertise making me better suitable for dealing with problems. Like Michael, I need to change my attitude towards books, especially non-fictional books focused on providing information. </p>
